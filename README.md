# Chameleon-Button
A simple UI component / front-end utility project named Chameleon-Button, intended to provide styled button(s) for web applications.

## Overview
This project bundles HTML, CSS (and possibly JavaScript) to define one or more customizable button styles — aiming to make it easy to reuse consistent button components in webpages.

## What it contains
1. HTML/CSS (and optionally JS) files that define the button’s look and behavior.
2. Pre-defined button styles (colors, states like hover/active, maybe different themes) — so you don’t need to write button-styling from scratch.
3. A clean, minimal structure so this component can be easily imported or copied into other web projects.

## Purpose & Use Case
Use this project if you want a ready-made button component for your web frontend. It saves time making buttons, ensures consistent styling, and can serve as a base to extend/customize button behavior for your own websites.
